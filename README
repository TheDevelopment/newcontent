NewContent

This is a small rails app which scans a directory, generates a MD5 for all the files, then stores
the MD5, the path and the filename in a database. From there, it detects any new additions or modifications
to files within that directory structure.

===TO BE DONE===
Generate the XML page which Boxee can read. Additionally need to generate a Boxee repository so I can load
the NewContent feed.
